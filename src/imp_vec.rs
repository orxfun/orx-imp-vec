/// `ImpVec`, standing for immutable push vector ðŸ‘¿, is a data structure which allows appending elements with a shared reference.
///
/// Specifically, it extends vector capabilities with the following two methods:
/// * `fn imp_push(&self, value: T)`
/// * `fn imp_extend_from_slice(&self, slice: &[T])`
///
/// Note that both of these methods can be called with `&self` rather than `&mut self`.
///
/// # Motivation
///
/// Appending to a vector with a shared reference sounds unconventional, and it is.
/// However, if we consider our vector as a bag of or a container of things rather than having a collective meaning;
/// then, appending element or elements to the end of the vector:
/// * does not mutate any of already added elements, and hence,
/// * **it is not different than creating a new element in the scope**.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// It is natural to expect that appending elements to a vector does not affect already added elements.
/// However, this is usually not the case due to underlying memory management.
/// For instance, `std::vec::Vec` may move already added elements to different memory locations to maintain the contagious layout of the vector.
///
/// `PinnedVec` prevents such implicit changes in memory locations.
/// It guarantees that push and extend methods keep memory locations of already added elements intact.
/// Therefore, it is perfectly safe to hold on to references of the vector while appending elements.
///
/// Consider the classical example that does not compile, which is often presented to highlight the safety guarantees of rust:
///
/// ```rust
/// let mut vec = vec![0, 1, 2, 3];
///
/// let ref_to_first = &vec[0];
/// assert_eq!(ref_to_first, &0);
///
/// vec.push(4);
///
/// // does not compile due to the following reason:  cannot borrow `vec` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
/// // assert_eq!(ref_to_first, &0);
/// ```
///
/// This wonderful feature of the borrow checker of rust is not required and used for `imp_push` and `imp_extend_from_slice` methods of `ImpVec`
/// since these methods do not require a `&mut self` reference.
/// Therefore, the following code compiles and runs perfectly safely.
